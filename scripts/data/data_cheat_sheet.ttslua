--
-- Deploy touching the rear table edge or Waterway 
--     of their own deployment area (i.e. at least 4 BW  
--     from the table sides) in Good Going (not Plough).
--
--
--  Can be guarded by a non-allied element or civilians
--  Elephants and SCh cannot be used to guard Camps
--  Troops can enter or leave through any edge
--  A Threat Zone extends from all sides of a Camp
--
--3 enemy (except SCh) can be in front edge contact
--Each fights in turn, using their foot combat factors
--No overlaps, side or rear supports are allowed
--Double base troops cannot use their +1 
--Defenders suffer -1 for each 2nd or 3rd still in contact
--
--  A victorious element must pursue into the Camp
--  Mounted pursue 1 BW, and foot pursue Â½ BW
--  Captured Camps are removed (except Edifice Camps)
--  Victory: a captured enemy Camp is worth 1 element
--
--
--
--Permanent Forts and Cities
--
--Defence Factors:   +4 to garrisoned foot
--                                               +2 to defending civilians
--              If enemy partially in a non-paltry River: +1 
--
--Place so that all of a City or Fort is within 6 BW of 2
--   battlefield edges. May touch any battlefield edge.

--
--Terrain Hints
--
--          Plough is Rough instead of Good Going if the 1st 
--          PIP roll is a â1â (or if less than â8â is rolled in BBDBA).
--
--   Place Waterway 1st, then compulsories, then others.
--   Plough and Linear Terrain must, Gentle Hills may,
--   extend into an adjacent quarter. Unlike other Area
--   Terrain features, a BUA can touch the table edges.
--+1 PIP:       if your General is fully in a Wood, Oasis, 
--                    Marsh, Gully, BUA, Camp, or out of range.
--
--Command Range:  reduced to 4 BW if fully in/beyond
--                    a Wood, Oasis, Dunes, a Difficult Hill, or if
--                    fully beyond any hill crest, BUA, or Camp.
--
--Shooting:  blocked by Â½ BW of Woods, Oasis, Dunes, 
--                    a Difficult Hill, an Edifice, a Hamlet, or if
--                    fully beyond any hill crest, City, or Fort.
--                    Cannot shoot if partially in a Marsh or River
--                    Cannot shoot or be shot at if fully in a Gully
--
--Pursuing:   not if currently in or would enter Woods, 
--                    Oasis, Dunes, a Difficult Hill, or an Edifice.
--                    A Marsh or Gully does not halt a pursuit.
--
--Fleeing:     halt if Bad Going other than a Marsh is met.
--                   Destroyed if fleeing into any River.
